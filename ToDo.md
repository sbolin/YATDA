## Things to do:
- fix bugs

## Bugs to fix:
- Sort behavior not consistent - some items refuse to sort properly, and sorting is odd. My be section designation. 
- TodoEditView doesn't show correct priority in segmented picker and can't change it.
- Widget not updating (Seems to be xcode bug?)

## One day to do:
- "Simple entry" - like Reminders app, when entering todo hit return and new todo is automatically created
