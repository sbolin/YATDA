#  YATDA
## Things to do:
~~- Reorder list (need to work this out, as view is automatically sorted via fetch)~~

## Bugs to fix:
- TodoEditView doesn't show correct priority in segmented picker and can't change it.
~~- ContentView re-arrange rows doesn't work properly - rows jump back. Possibly due to not save or maybe section setup.~~

## One day to do:
- "Simple entry" - like Reminders app, when entering todo hit return and new todo is automatically created
