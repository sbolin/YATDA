## Things to do:
- removed reordering, as it is problematic. Sortting works ok, so use that for now.
- fix bugs
- Widget is problematic....
- Refactor

## Bugs to fix:
- Widget not updating (Seems to be xcode bug?)

## One day to do:
- "Simple entry" - like Reminders app, when entering todo hit return and new todo is automatically created
- Notifications
- Tags? (big change, as it requires change in DB)

## Fixed
~~- TodoEditView doesn't show correct priority in segmented picker and can't change it.~~
~~- Sort behavior not consistent - some items refuse to sort properly, and sorting is odd. My be section designation.~~
